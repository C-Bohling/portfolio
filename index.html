                        My name is Caleb and I am a highschool homeschooler 
                        who loves coding. I started coding when I was 10 with 
                        scratch (I guess that counts). After I learned the 
                        limits of scratch I decided to learn something new.
                        In 2018 I started learning Python 3 with some simple 
                        learn-to-code books. I was only 12 then and did not 
                        try to learn things like lists or objects. Because of
                        that cap I was setting for myself I really did not do
                        to many interesting things with python until 2020. At that 
                        point I learned lists, dictionaries, and objects. Whole 
                        new sets of possibilities opened up and I started 
                        building much more fun projects like simple data analyzers 
                        and programs to help me with my latin practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022 I was hired to build a job tracking website for a 
                        commercial furniture company, so I 
                        learned Django. I don't think I was ever very good at 
                        Django, but I successfully built a fairly simple job 
                        tracking website. It was a fairly limited site and I
                        had not really learned how to use JavaScript, so there 
                        was much left to be improved. I am now taking Codecademy's
                        full-stack development course, and I am learning so much.
                        I am excited to see what happens next!

                                and I built this one afternoon for the fun of it.

                                This simple web app generates a random sentence at
                                the click of the mouse. This was the first project
                                I ever did that used JavaScript with the document
                                object.
